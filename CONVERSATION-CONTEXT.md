- Peer learning through observing multiple approaches
- Fun, memorable learning experience

### Sessions 5-8: Board Simulation Case Studies
Two major case studies where students role-play as board members:

**Case 1: Liberty Regional Bank - AI Loan Screening** ✅ COMPLETED
- Company: Community bank considering AI loan approval system
- Dilemma: AI shows 23% auto-decline rate for Black applicants vs. 12% for white applicants
- Tension: Efficiency vs. fairness, vendor dependency, competitive pressure
- Student vote result: "Delay 6 Months" (Option 3) - 5 of 7 votes
- Key learning: Students engaged well with trade-offs but didn't consider that human processes were never audited for bias

**Case 2: TrendSetters Retail - Marketing AI** 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- Company: Mid-size retail chain
- Dilemma: AI-powered personalization and marketing decisions
- Tension: Customer privacy, personalization benefits, competitive advantage

---

## What We Learned from Case 1

### What Worked Well
✅ **Student engagement**: Students took the board simulation seriously and engaged deeply  
✅ **Trade-off analysis**: Students understood there were no perfect solutions  
✅ **Peer influence**: Students' arguments during deliberation actually changed votes  
✅ **AI tool usage**: Students used AI appropriately to research and analyze options  
✅ **Realistic scenarios**: Business context felt authentic and relevant

### Gaps Observed
❌ **Baseline comparison**: Students didn't consider that human loan officers were never audited for bias - they assumed human process was fair and only questioned the AI  
❌ **Second-order effects**: Some students focused on immediate decision without thinking about longer-term implications  
❌ **Stakeholder depth**: Students identified stakeholders but didn't always analyze impacts deeply

### Adjustments for Future Cases
- Make baseline comparisons more explicit in scenarios
- Encourage students to question ALL systems (human or AI)
- Push for deeper stakeholder impact analysis
- Continue emphasizing that reasonable people can disagree

- **Before case studies** (Sessions 5-8): Need to practice prompt skills in real-time
- **Mid-semester energy**: Games are engaging when students might be hitting fatigue

**What Card Game Provides That Case Studies Don't**:
1. **Real-time pressure**: No time to overthink, must collaborate with AI quickly
2. **Multiple attempts**: See 17 different prompt approaches to same challenges
3. **Strategic gameplay**: Risk/reward decisions (accept challenge or pass)
4. **Immediate feedback**: See what works and doesn't work in real-time
5. **Peer learning**: Learn from watching others' successes and struggles
6. **Lower stakes**: Game format feels less intimidating than formal case analysis
7. **Competition**: Creates energy and engagement
8. **Memorable**: Students will remember the game experience

**Skills Bridge to Case Studies**:
- Prompt quality → Will need for Case 1 & 2 pre-meeting assignments
- AI consultation → Will use AI during case study deliberations  
- Debate skills → Will present and defend positions in board meetings
