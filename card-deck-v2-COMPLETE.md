### **Card S3-01**

🟢 **EASY PROMPT CARD (100 POINTS - WARM-UP)**

---

**📋 MINI-CASE:**

Bean There Coffee operates 3 locations in your region. Owner Maria currently orders inventory based on gut feel and often over-orders (leading to waste) or under-orders (running out of popular items). She has 18 months of daily sales data in Excel spreadsheets. Maria has no technical staff and has never used AI tools before. She's excited but intimidated by the idea of "AI-powered inventory optimization."

**🎯 YOUR CHALLENGE:**

Write a prompt asking an AI tool to help Maria understand what's realistically possible with her data and what her first steps should be. Your prompt should help her think through options, not just get a solution handed to her.

**📋 MINI-CASE:**

You're the social media manager for a local gym. A negative review just went viral (2,000 shares in 3 hours) claiming your facility discriminates against plus-size members. The claim is based on a misunderstanding—a staff member awkwardly tried to help someone adjust equipment and it was misinterpreted. You need to respond quickly but carefully. Your boss wants to see a draft response in 30 minutes. You've never handled a crisis like this before.

**🎯 YOUR CHALLENGE:**

Write a prompt asking AI to help you think through how to respond to this crisis. Your prompt should help you consider your options and implications, not just generate a response for you to copy/paste.

### **Card S3-03**

🟢 **EASY PROMPT CARD (100 POINTS - WARM-UP)**

---

**📋 MINI-CASE:**

You own a small Italian restaurant. You're planning next month's menu and want to introduce 2-3 new dishes. You have:
- Sales data showing which current dishes are most/least popular
- Customer feedback from comment cards (mostly qualitative: "loved the pasta," "portions too small")
- Knowledge of seasonal ingredient availability and costs
- A chef who's great at execution but not creative with new recipes

Could AI help you decide which new dishes to test, or is this too subjective/creative for AI to be useful?

**💭 PROPOSITION:**

"Dating apps should be required to disclose and explain how their AI matching algorithms work (what factors they prioritize, how compatibility is calculated) so users understand why they're seeing certain matches, even if this reduces the 'magic' appeal and reveals proprietary methods."

**🎯 YOUR CHALLENGE:**

1. ✅ Choose: FOR or AGAINST disclosure requirement
2. ✅ Prepare and present a 5-minute argument
3. ✅ Address at least one strong counterargument
4. ✅ Use specific examples or evidence

**⏰ PREP TIME:** 2 minutes (can use AI during prep)

**🎤 PRESENTATION:** 5 minutes

---

**💡 KEY CONSIDERATIONS (FOR):** Users deserve to know how they're being judged/sorted, might reveal biases (racial preference algorithms), informed consent, people making life decisions

**💡 KEY CONSIDERATIONS (AGAINST):** Revealing algorithm allows gaming the system, destroys competitive advantage, most users don't care about technical details, would make apps less effective

### **Card S4-D5**

🔵 **DEBATE CARD (400 POINTS)**

---

**💭 PROPOSITION:**

"Teachers should be allowed to use AI to grade student essays and written assignments (not just grammar, but content, argumentation, creativity) to save time, as long as students have the option to request human re-review if they disagree with the AI's grade."

**🎯 YOUR CHALLENGE:**

1. ✅ Choose: FOR or AGAINST AI grading with human review option
2. ✅ Prepare and present a 5-minute argument
3. ✅ Address at least one strong counterargument
4. ✅ Use specific examples or evidence

**⏰ PREP TIME:** 2 minutes (can use AI during prep)

**🎤 PRESENTATION:** 5 minutes

---

**💡 KEY CONSIDERATIONS (FOR):** Frees teachers for actual teaching (not grading), provides faster feedback, might be MORE consistent than humans, human review option protects students

**💡 KEY CONSIDERATIONS (AGAINST):** Misses nuance and growth, reduces writing to checklist, students will game the AI, devalues teacher expertise, "request human review" puts burden on students
