## Pre-Game Setup

### Before Students Arrive (15 minutes prep time)

**Materials Checklist:**
- [ ] Card deck printed or ready to display digitally
- [ ] Scoring sheets printed (one per team)
- [ ] Leaderboard visible (Google Sheet projected OR whiteboard)
- [ ] Timer ready (visible to all students)
- [ ] Rubric quick-reference checklists printed
- [ ] Student handouts (17 copies)
- [ ] Team assignments prepared

**Technology Setup:**
- [ ] Projector/screen working
- [ ] WiFi password posted (students need AI access)
- [ ] Leaderboard Google Sheet open (if using digital)
- [ ] Backup: Whiteboard markers if tech fails

**Room Setup:**
- [ ] Three distinct team areas (tables/clusters)
- [ ] Clear view of leaderboard from all team areas
- [ ] Space for teams to consult privately during game

**Team Assignments:**

Base teams on Case 1 & 2 performance to balance skill levels:

**Strategy for Team Assignment:**
1. Identify students who scored highest on Case 1 prompt quality
2. Distribute them across three teams
3. Balance by mixing ages, backgrounds, personalities
4. Avoid putting best friends together (too comfortable = less competitive)
5. Put one "quieter" student per team (first-timer bonus encourages participation)

**Announce teams at start of class** - don't let students self-select.

## How to Run Each Round

### PRE-GAME SETUP (10 minutes - Session 3 only)

**0:00-0:03: Announce Teams**

"Welcome! Today we're playing the AI Challenge Card Game. This is competitive but also collaborative—you'll learn a ton from watching each other.

I've assigned you to three teams strategically. Here are your teams:

**Red Team:** [Names]  
**Blue Team:** [Names]  
**Yellow Team:** [Names]

Please move to your team areas now. Choose a team captain who will submit your prompts/present debates."

**0:03-0:07: Explain Rules**

"Here's how this works:

1. **Card Types**: Prompt cards (you write prompts for AI) and Debate cards (you argue a position)

2. **Strategic Choice**: When it's your turn, you can ACCEPT the challenge OR PASS. If you pass, you lose 100 points and the next team gets the option.

3. **Points**: Easy prompts = 200 points, Medium = 300, Hard = 400, Debates = 350-400. Your score depends on quality using our rubrics.

4. **First-Timer Bonus**: First time any individual student presents for their team = +100 bonus points. This encourages everyone to participate.

5. **Leaderboard**: You'll see scores update throughout the game on [point to screen/whiteboard].

Questions?"

**0:07-0:10: Distribute Handouts & Show Example**

"Here's your student handout with all the rules and an example card.

Let me show you one example card and how it would be scored..."

[Display an easy card, walk through what makes a good answer using rubric]

---

### ROUND 1: WARM-UP (20 minutes Session 3, 15 minutes Session 4)

**Purpose**: Practice format, low-stakes, everyone gets comfortable

**Structure**: Rotate through all three teams, one easy card each

**Timing per Card:**
- 5 minutes: Write prompt
- 2 minutes: Score and explain
- 13 seconds: Update leaderboard

**Cards for Session 3 Warm-Up:**
- Card S3-01: Coffee Shop Inventory (Red Team)
- Card S3-02: Social Media Crisis (Blue Team)
- Card S3-03: Restaurant Menu Planning (Yellow Team)

**How to Run:**

**Red Team's Turn:**

1. **Display Card** (or read aloud if printed)
   "Red Team, here's your first card. You have 5 minutes starting... NOW."

2. **Start Timer** (visible to all)
   Students use their devices to write prompt.
   Team discusses and writes together.

3. **At 4 Minutes**: "One minute remaining"

4. **At 5 Minutes**: "Time's up! Red Team, submit your prompt to me."
   [They can email, share doc, or read aloud depending on your preference]

5. **Score Immediately** (2 minutes)
   - Use Prompt Quality Quick-Score Checklist
   - Announce score and brief feedback
   - "Red Team wrote a proficient prompt. They provided good context about Maria's situation and asked for options rather than just an answer. Score: 170 points out of 200. Great start!"

6. **Update Leaderboard** (15 seconds)
   Red Team: 170 points

**Blue Team's Turn** (same process)

**Yellow Team's Turn** (same process)

**After Round 1:**
"Great warm-up! You're getting the hang of it. Scores so far:
- Red Team: 170
- Blue Team: 185
- Yellow Team: 160

Now we move to the main game with higher-stakes cards and strategic decisions. Remember, you can PASS if you don't want a card—but you lose 100 points."

---

### ROUND 2: MAIN GAME (75 minutes Session 3, 90 minutes Session 4)

**Purpose**: Competitive gameplay, strategic decisions, mix of prompts and debates

**Structure**: 
- Mix of Medium/Hard Prompts and Debates
- Teams can ACCEPT or PASS
- Includes AI Consultation Breaks

**Cards for Session 3 Main Game:**
- 6 Medium Prompts (300 pts each)
- 3 Hard Prompts (400 pts each)
- 4 Debates (350 pts each)

**Turn Order**: Rotate (Red → Blue → Yellow → Red...)

**Timing per Prompt Card:**
- Team decides: Accept or Pass (30 seconds)
- If ACCEPT: 5 minutes to write, 2 minutes to score
- If PASS: Next team gets option (30 seconds each until accepted)

**Timing per Debate Card:**
- Team decides: Accept or Pass (30 seconds)
- If ACCEPT: Choose FOR/AGAINST (30 seconds)
- Prep time: 2 minutes (can use AI)
- Presentation: 5 minutes
- Opposing teams vote: 1 minute
- Score: 2 minutes

**How to Handle Turn:**

**Display Card (30 seconds):**
"Red Team, this is a Medium Prompt Card worth 300 points. You have 30 seconds to decide: ACCEPT or PASS?"

**If ACCEPT:**
"Red Team accepts! You have 5 minutes starting NOW."
[Timer starts, proceed as normal]

**If PASS:**
"Red Team passes. Minus 100 points from Red Team.
Blue Team, you now have the option to ACCEPT or PASS this card?"

[Continue until a team accepts or all teams pass]

**If ALL Teams Pass:**
"All teams passed. This card is discarded. No points awarded or lost beyond the pass penalties. Moving to next card."

**AI Consultation Breaks** (Schedule 2-3 per session):**

After every 4-5 cards:
"Consultation break! You have 5 minutes to use AI tools to research, strategize, or prepare for upcoming cards. Teams, huddle up and decide how to use this time wisely."

[This gives teams breathing room and encourages AI use]

**Managing Time:**

If running behind:
- Shorten consultation breaks to 3 minutes
- Speed up scoring ("I'll announce scores, full feedback posted later")
- Skip one debate card if necessary

If running ahead:
- Add an extra debate card
- Longer consultation breaks
- More detailed feedback during scoring

### ROUND 3: LIGHTNING ROUND (15 minutes both sessions)

**Purpose**: Catch-up opportunity for losing team, high-energy finale

**Structure**: Rapid-fire easy prompts, 90 seconds each

**Cards**: 2-3 easy prompts from lightning round section

**Special Rule**: Losing team (lowest score) gets first pick on every card in lightning round

**How to Run:**

"We're entering the Lightning Round! These are fast—90 seconds to write your prompt.

Special rule: The team in last place gets first choice on every card. If they pass, second-place team gets next option, etc.

Current standings:
- Blue Team: 2,250 points (1st)
- Red Team: 2,180 points (2nd)
- Yellow Team: 1,840 points (3rd)

Yellow Team, you get first choice on every lightning card!"

**Lightning Card Process:**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Team is stuck/confused on a card**

**Solution:** 
- At 2-minute mark, offer hint: "Think about who's affected by this decision."
- Don't give answer, just help them think
- If really stuck at 4 minutes: "What would you ask your manager if you were in this situation?"

**Issue: One student dominating their team**

**Solution:**
- Remind about first-timer bonus: "Remember, each NEW person who presents gets your team +100 points."
- During consultation break, quietly tell dominator: "You're doing great—now help your teammates step up. The bonus points reward spreading the work."

**Issue: Debate is going over 5 minutes**

**Solution:**
- At 5 minutes: "Wrap up your final point in the next 20 seconds."
- Don't be rigid, but keep it moving
- If they keep going at 6 minutes: "Thank you, that's time. Let's move to voting."

**Issue: All teams pass on a card**

**Solution:**
- "No problem! This card is discarded. Moving on."
- Don't make a big deal of it
- Note for next semester: that card might be too hard or confusing

**Issue: Debate peer vote is tied or confusing**

**Solution:**
- If both opposing teams vote NO: Team gets base score only (no +75 bonus)
- If one votes YES and one votes NO: Team gets the +75 bonus (benefit of doubt)
- If teams are confused about how to vote: "Did their argument convince you? If yes, vote yes."

**Issue: Technology fails (projector dies, WiFi out)**

**Solution:**
- Backup: Use printed cards and whiteboard
- Backup: Hotspot from your phone for WiFi
- Worst case: Run game verbally (read cards aloud, track scores on paper)

**Issue: Running significantly over time**

**Solution:**
- Cut consultation breaks to 2 minutes
- Lightning round: Only 1 card instead of 2-3
- Skip final debate card in main game
- Shorten debrief to 5 minutes

**Issue: Running significantly under time**

**Solution:**
- Add extra consultation break
- Add bonus debate card
- Lightning round: Do 4 cards instead of 2
- Longer debrief discussion

**Issue: Scoring disputes**

**Solution:**
- Student questions their score: "I used the rubric consistently. Let me show you where your prompt scored well and where it could improve."
- If they used a Power-Up (Challenge Score card): Re-evaluate more carefully
- Final call is yours, but be fair and consistent

**Issue: Team chemistry problems**

**Solution:**
- If team members aren't collaborating: During consultation break, check in privately
- Remind them it's TEAM score (they succeed together)
- For Session 4, consider minor team adjustments if serious issues

## Emergency Backup Plan

### If Game Completely Fails

**Reasons game might fail:**
- Technology complete breakdown
- Students extremely confused despite explanations
- Time mismanagement catastrophe
- Unexpected circumstances (fire drill, etc.)

**Backup Activity:**

**Mini Case Study** (if >30 minutes remain):
- Use one of the Hard Prompt cards as a mini case study
- Have students individually write prompts
- Discuss as whole class
- Grade as regular assignment

**Structured Discussion** (if <30 minutes remain):
- Use debate cards as discussion topics
- Whole-class debate format
- Less structured, but still valuable

**Don't Panic:**
- Students will still learn even if game doesn't go perfectly
- Be flexible and adaptive
- Can always run Session 4 as originally planned
