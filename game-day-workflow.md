## PRO TIPS FOR SMOOTH GAMEPLAY

### Before Each Card:
✅ Have card already visible in G-doc (just scroll to it)
✅ Have timer ready
✅ Remind teams of point values

### During Scoring:
✅ Copy my ENTIRE response (scores + justifications)
✅ Don't edit it - paste as-is for authenticity
✅ If you disagree with a score, ask me to reconsider with more context

### Managing Time:
✅ Use visual timer if possible (screen share)
✅ Give 1-minute warnings
✅ Be flexible - if teams need 1-2 extra minutes, it's okay
✅ Lightning rounds are truly meant to be fast (enforce strictly)

### Handling Questions:
✅ Students may ask "How did Team X get more points?"
✅ Point to my justifications in the G-doc
✅ Offer to ask me for more detailed feedback

### If Claude (me) is Slow:
✅ Use the wait time to discuss previous card learnings
✅ Have teams reflect on their own prompts
✅ Ask class what they think made prompts strong/weak

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: Teams submit at different times**
- Solution: Set hard deadline, paste all at once when time is up

**Problem: Voice-to-text misses debate points**
- Solution: Ask presenter to repeat or clarify
- Backup: Have team also paste key points in chat

**Problem: Debate goes over time**
- Solution: Give 30-second warning, then cut off politely
- Can allow brief rebuttal if time permits

**Problem: Claude.ai is down or slow**
- Solution: Have backup rubrics printed, score manually
- Or: Postpone card and do different one

**Problem: Students complain about scores**
- Solution: Point to rubric, explain what was missing
- Offer: "You can ask Claude to explain the score more"

---

## END OF GAME

### Final Leaderboard:
1. Announce winners
2. Highlight best prompt/argument of the day
3. Quick reflection: What did we learn about prompting?

### Debrief Questions:
- What made the highest-scoring prompts effective?
- How is collaborating with AI different from delegating to AI?
- What surprised you about how the AI responded?
- How will you apply this to your own AI use?

### Save Everything:
- Keep G-doc for students to review
- Note which cards worked well (use again)
- Note which cards were confusing (revise or skip)

```
This conversation - where you:
- Paste team submissions
- Get evaluations from me
- Ask follow-up questions
```
