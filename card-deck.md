║  MINI-CASE:                                                  ║
║  Bean There Coffee operates 3 locations in your region.      ║
║  Owner Maria currently orders inventory based on gut feel    ║
║  and often over-orders (leading to waste) or under-orders    ║
║  (running out of popular items). She has 18 months of daily  ║
║  sales data in Excel spreadsheets. Maria has no technical    ║
║  staff and has never used AI tools before. She's excited     ║
║  but intimidated by the idea of "AI-powered inventory        ║
║  optimization."                                              ║
║                                                              ║
║  YOUR CHALLENGE:                                             ║
║  Write a prompt asking an AI tool to help Maria understand   ║
║  what's realistically possible with her data and what her    ║
║  first steps should be. Your prompt should help her think    ║
║  through options, not just get a solution handed to her.     ║
║                                                              ║

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**What Makes This "Easy":**
- Single straightforward business problem (inventory waste)
- Clear context provided (3 locations, Excel data, no tech background)
- Obvious what's being asked (understand possibilities + first steps)

**Scoring Using Prompt Quality Rubric:**

**Exceptional (90-100 pts):**
- Provides Maria's context (small business, no tech staff, intimidated)
- Asks for explanation of options (not just recommendation)
- Frames as "help me understand" not "tell me what to do"
- Sets up follow-up: "After you explain options, I'll want to know..."

**Proficient (70-89 pts):**
- Mentions key context (Excel data, no technical experience)
- Asks for something useful (understanding options or first steps)
- Shows awareness this is about helping Maria think

**Developing (50-69 pts):**
- Generic question ("How can AI help with inventory?")
- Minimal context provided
- Asks AI to make the decision

**Common Mistakes to Watch:**
- ❌ "What should Maria do?" (delegates decision)
- ❌ No mention of her constraints (no tech staff, intimidated)
- ❌ Asks for complex technical solution (doesn't match her capabilities)
- ❌ No follow-up questions planned

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Context about Maria's situation?
- [ ] Asks to understand options (not just get answer)?
- [ ] Appropriate for her capabilities?
- [ ] Sets up follow-up or critical evaluation?

**Sample Strong Prompt:**
"I'm helping a coffee shop owner who has 18 months of daily sales data in Excel but no technical background. She's interested in using AI to reduce inventory waste but is intimidated by technology. Can you explain what's realistically possible with her data, what tools exist that don't require programming skills, and what her first 2-3 steps should be to explore this? I want to help her make an informed decision, not just tell her what to do."

║  You're the social media manager for a local gym. A         ║
║  negative review just went viral (2,000 shares in 3 hours)  ║
║  claiming your facility discriminates against plus-size      ║
║  members. The claim is based on a misunderstanding—a staff   ║
║  member awkwardly tried to help someone adjust equipment     ║
║  and it was misinterpreted. You need to respond quickly but  ║
║  carefully. Your boss wants to see a draft response in 30    ║
║  minutes. You've never handled a crisis like this before.    ║
║                                                              ║
║  YOUR CHALLENGE:                                             ║
║  Write a prompt asking AI to help you think through how to   ║
║  respond to this crisis. Your prompt should help you         ║
║  consider your options and implications, not just generate   ║
║  a response for you to copy/paste.                           ║
║                                                              ║
║  TIME LIMIT: 5 minutes to write + submit                     ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**What Makes This "Easy":**
- Clear crisis situation everyone can relate to
- Specific context provided (type of accusation, time pressure)
- Obvious emotional component (but straightforward problem)

**Scoring Using Prompt Quality Rubric:**

**Exceptional (90-100 pts):**
- Provides full context (what happened, viral spread, time pressure)
- Asks for help thinking through options (not drafting response)
- Requests consideration of multiple stakeholder perspectives
- Plans to evaluate AI's suggestions critically

**Proficient (70-89 pts):**
- Describes the crisis situation clearly
- Asks for strategic guidance (not just a response to copy)
- Shows awareness of need to think carefully

**Developing (50-69 pts):**
- Basic description of problem
- Asks AI to write the response (delegation)
- Minimal strategic thinking

**Common Mistakes to Watch:**
- ❌ "Write a response to this review" (asks AI to do the work)
- ❌ No context about the misunderstanding
- ❌ Doesn't ask about implications of different approaches
- ❌ Treats AI as copywriter rather than thinking partner

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Describes crisis with context?
- [ ] Asks for strategic thinking help (not just content generation)?
- [ ] Shows awareness of stakeholder impacts?
- [ ] Plans to evaluate options critically?

║  MINI-CASE:                                                  ║
║  You manage a family restaurant that's been serving the same ║
║  menu for 15 years. Sales are declining 8% annually as newer ║
║  restaurants open nearby. You have customer feedback surveys ║
║  from the past 2 years (mostly complaints about "boring      ║
║  menu" and "same old dishes"). Your chef is 58 years old and ║
║  proud of the traditional recipes. Your budget for menu      ║
║  changes is $5,000. You need to present a menu update plan   ║
║  to the owner next week.                                     ║
║                                                              ║
║  YOUR CHALLENGE:                                             ║
║  Write a prompt asking AI to help you think through how to   ║
║  approach this menu update strategically. Your prompt should ║
║  help you understand your options and trade-offs, not just   ║
║  get a list of trendy dishes to add.                         ║
║                                                              ║
║  TIME LIMIT: 5 minutes to write + submit                     ║

- Relatable business problem (declining sales, competition)
- Clear constraints (budget, traditional chef, timeline)
- Not life-or-death stakes (menu changes are reversible)

**Scoring Using Prompt Quality Rubric:**

**Exceptional (90-100 pts):**
- Includes all key constraints ($5K budget, traditional chef, timeline)
- Asks for strategic approach (not just trendy dish ideas)
- Recognizes human element (chef's pride)
- Plans follow-up to evaluate trade-offs

**Proficient (70-89 pts):**
- Mentions main constraints
- Asks for approach or options
- Shows business thinking

**Developing (50-69 pts):**
- Asks "what dishes should we add?"
- Minimal context about situation
- Doesn't consider strategic implications

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Includes constraints (budget, chef, timeline)?
- [ ] Asks for strategic approach (not just menu items)?
- [ ] Considers stakeholder dynamics (chef, customers, owner)?

## Main Game - Prompt Cards (9 cards: 6 Medium, 3 Hard)

### Card S3-04: Healthcare AI Transcription (Medium - 300 points)

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  🟡 MEDIUM PROMPT CARD                            300 POINTS ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  MINI-CASE:                                                  ║
║  Riverside Medical Clinic serves 2,500 patients. Doctors     ║
║  spend 90 minutes daily on medical note documentation,       ║
║  causing burnout. An AI transcription vendor offers real-    ║
║  time dictation that automatically generates clinical notes. ║
║  Projected savings: $180K annually in physician time. Cost:  ║
║  $85K/year. However, 3 concerns have emerged: (1) Patients   ║
║  worry about AI "listening" to sensitive conversations, (2)  ║
║  Doctors worry about liability if AI misrecords critical     ║
║  information, (3) Two nurses fear this is first step toward  ║
║  broader AI replacing human clinical judgment.               ║
║                                                              ║
║  YOUR CHALLENGE:                                             ║
║  You're the clinic administrator. Write a prompt asking AI   ║
║  to help you think through whether to pilot this system.     ║
║  Your prompt should help you understand the key trade-offs   ║
║  and what questions you need to answer before deciding.      ║
║                                                              ║
║  TIME LIMIT: 5 minutes to write + submit                     ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**What Makes This "Medium":**
- Multiple stakeholders with different concerns (patients, doctors, nurses)
- Competing values (efficiency vs. safety vs. trust)
- Financial calculation is straightforward but human factors are complex
- No obvious "right answer"

**Scoring Using Prompt Quality Rubric:**

**Exceptional (90-94%):**
- Provides full context including all three stakeholder concerns
- Asks for help understanding trade-offs (not for recommendation)
- Shows strategic thinking (pilot vs. full deployment, risk mitigation)
- Plans to critically evaluate AI's analysis of risks

**Excellent (85-89%):**
- Good context about the situation and concerns
- Asks about trade-offs and key questions
- Shows awareness of multiple stakeholders

**Proficient (75-84%):**
- Describes the scenario adequately
- Asks for analysis of pros/cons
- Some stakeholder awareness

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ "Should we buy this system?" (asks AI to decide)
- ❌ Only focuses on financial ROI, ignores human concerns
- ❌ Doesn't distinguish between different stakeholder worries
- ❌ No plan for pilot or risk mitigation

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Mentions all three stakeholder groups?
- [ ] Asks about trade-offs and key questions (not just recommendation)?
- [ ] Shows strategic thinking about implementation?
- [ ] Plans critical evaluation of AI's suggestions?

**What Strong Answers Recognize:**
- This is about trust and change management, not just technology
- Liability concerns are real (medical documentation errors have consequences)
- Patients' privacy concerns might be about transparency (explain AI is transcribing)
- Nurses' concerns about job displacement need addressing even if not immediate
- Pilot could address many concerns (test accuracy, patient acceptance)

### Card S3-05: E-commerce Chatbot Decision (Medium - 300 points)

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  🟡 MEDIUM PROMPT CARD                            300 POINTS ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  MINI-CASE:                                                  ║
║  Your mid-size e-commerce company (250 employees, $45M       ║
║  annual revenue) currently has 12 customer service reps      ║
║  handling 1,200 support tickets daily. Average resolution    ║
║  time: 18 minutes. Customer satisfaction: 87%. A vendor      ║
║  proposes an AI chatbot that could handle 70% of routine     ║
║  inquiries automatically. Projected outcome: Reduce CS team  ║
║  to 5 reps, save $420K annually, improve response time to    ║
║  under 2 minutes. Risk: Customer satisfaction might drop to  ║
║  75-80% initially as customers adjust. Your CS manager says  ║
║  "Our customers value talking to humans—this will backfire." ║
║                                                              ║
║  YOUR CHALLENGE:                                             ║
║  You're the COO deciding whether to deploy this chatbot.     ║
║  Write a prompt asking AI to help you think through this     ║
║  decision strategically. Focus on what you need to know,     ║
║  not what you should do.                                     ║
║                                                              ║
║  TIME LIMIT: 5 minutes to write + submit                     ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**What Makes This "Medium":**
- Clear financial benefit vs. customer experience trade-off
- Involves layoffs (ethical dimension)
- Manager's pushback adds complexity
- Numbers are provided but interpretation matters

**Scoring Guidance:**

**Exceptional (90-94%):**
- Acknowledges financial case AND customer experience concerns
- Asks about options beyond binary yes/no (hybrid approaches?)
- Considers CS manager's perspective (what if they're right?)
- Plans to evaluate assumptions (will satisfaction really drop? by how much?)

**Excellent (85-89%):**
- Good context about trade-offs
- Asks strategic questions about implementation
- Shows stakeholder awareness

**Proficient (75-84%):**
- Describes situation adequately
- Asks for analysis of decision
- Some nuance present

**What Strong Answers Consider:**
- What makes customers value "talking to humans"? (Maybe it's speed/resolution, not humanness)
- Hybrid model: Chatbot for simple stuff, escalate to humans quickly
- 70% automation = still need 5 reps (that's 7 layoffs—how to handle?)
- Initial satisfaction drop might recover as chatbot improves
- CS manager might be resistant to change vs. genuinely knowing customers

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Acknowledges both financial and customer experience concerns?
- [ ] Asks about key assumptions or unknowns?
- [ ] Considers options beyond yes/no?
- [ ] Shows plan for evaluating AI's analysis?

║  MINI-CASE:                                                  ║
║  You run a local insurance agency with 6 agents. Marketing   ║
║  has always been word-of-mouth and occasional Facebook posts.║
║  A marketing consultant proposes using AI tools to: (1)      ║
║  Generate social media content, (2) Write personalized email ║
║  campaigns, (3) Create blog posts about insurance topics.    ║
║  Cost: $300/month for tools + $1,200/month for consultant.   ║
║  Consultant claims you could reach 5× more potential clients.║
║  Your concern: "Will AI-generated content sound generic and  ║
║  hurt our personal, local reputation?" You've built your     ║
║  business on authentic relationships, not marketing tactics. ║
║                                                              ║
║  YOUR CHALLENGE:                                             ║
║  Write a prompt asking AI to help you think through whether  ║
║  this marketing approach fits your business values and goals.║
║  Your prompt should help you evaluate the consultant's       ║
║  claims and understand what success would actually require.  ║
║                                                              ║
║  TIME LIMIT: 5 minutes to write + submit                     ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**What Makes This "Medium":**
- Values conflict (authentic relationships vs. marketing automation)
- Unclear ROI (will 5× reach translate to clients?)
- Small business context (budget matters)
- Consultant may oversell results

**Scoring Guidance:**

**Exceptional (90-94%):**
- Names the values conflict (authenticity vs. automation)
- Asks how to evaluate consultant's claim (5× reach = how many actual clients?)
- Shows skepticism without dismissing idea
- Considers how AI could augment (not replace) authentic approach

**Excellent (85-89%):**
- Acknowledges the business values vs. marketing trade-off
- Asks strategic questions about ROI
- Shows critical thinking about claims

**Proficient (75-84%):**
- Describes situation adequately
- Asks whether to proceed
- Some awareness of concerns

**What Strong Answers Recognize:**
- 5× reach doesn't mean 5× clients (conversion matters)
- AI-generated content can be customized (doesn't have to be generic)
- Could use AI as starting point, then add personal touch
- $1,200/month consultant might be bigger question than $300 tools
- "Personal, local reputation" is the competitive advantage—protect it

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Acknowledges values conflict?
- [ ] Questions the ROI claim critically?
- [ ] Asks about how to maintain authenticity?
- [ ] Shows strategic thinking about implementation?

║  MINI-CASE:                                                  ║
║  Your school district serves 3,200 students, 48% qualify for║
║  free/reduced lunch. Test scores are below state average.    ║
║  An AI tutoring platform offers personalized learning paths  ║
║  for math and reading. Cost: $65 per student annually        ║
║  ($208K total). Vendor data shows 18% improvement in test    ║
║  scores from similar districts. However: (1) Your budget is  ║
║  tight—this means cutting 2 teacher aide positions, (2)      ║
║  Some parents worry about "replacing teachers with robots,"  ║
║  (3) Not all students have reliable internet at home. The    ║
║  superintendent wants a recommendation for the school board. ║
║                                                              ║

║  prompt asking AI to help you think through the key factors  ║
║  in this decision and what the superintendent should tell    ║
║  the school board about trade-offs.                          ║
║                                                              ║

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**What Makes This "Medium":**
- Education context (students' futures at stake)
- Equity issues (internet access, budget cuts affect lowest-income students)
- Multiple stakeholders (students, parents, teachers, school board)
- Vendor claims need evaluation (18% improvement = how measured?)

**Scoring Guidance:**

**Exceptional (90-94%):**
- Acknowledges all three concerns (budget cuts, parent worry, internet access)
- Questions vendor claims (18% improvement in what timeframe? All students?)
- Shows awareness of equity implications (cutting aides hurts students who need most help)
- Asks how to evaluate whether benefits justify trade-offs

**Excellent (85-89%):**
- Good context about constraints
- Asks about trade-offs thoughtfully
- Shows stakeholder awareness

**Proficient (75-84%):**
- Describes situation adequately
- Asks for analysis
- Some awareness of complexity

**What Strong Answers Recognize:**
- Cutting teacher aides to fund AI might reduce the one-on-one support students need
- Students without home internet can't benefit fully (equity issue)
- Parents' "replacing teachers" concern is about more than just test scores
- 18% improvement claim needs scrutiny (which students improved? Sustained?)
- Could pilot with smaller group before district-wide rollout

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Addresses equity and access concerns?
- [ ] Questions vendor's effectiveness claims?
- [ ] Considers trade-off of cutting aide positions?
- [ ] Shows strategic thinking about implementation?

║  MINI-CASE:                                                  ║
║  Your factory manufactures automotive parts for major car    ║
║  companies. Quality control currently employs 18 inspectors  ║
║  examining 12,000 parts daily. Defect rate: 2.3% (276 daily).║
║  An AI vision system vendor claims their system can detect   ║
║  defects with 98.7% accuracy—better than human inspectors'   ║
║  97.1% accuracy. Cost: $850K installation + $180K annually.  ║
║  Labor savings: 12 inspectors could be reassigned ($720K/yr).║
║  However: The 1.3% of defects AI misses could end up in      ║
║  customer vehicles (safety risk, recall cost = millions).    ║
║  Your head of QC says: "I don't trust any system that can't  ║

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**What Makes This "Medium":**
- High-stakes safety implications (automotive parts)
- Numbers look good but devil in details (what about the 1.3%?)
- Explainability concern is sophisticated (black box problem)
- Financial case is strong but risk is catastrophic

**Scoring Guidance:**

**Exceptional (90-94%):**
- Recognizes that 98.7% vs 97.1% accuracy needs context (what KIND of defects?)
- Addresses explainability concern seriously (why does QC head care?)
- Considers hybrid approach (AI + human spot-checks)
- Asks how to evaluate vendor claims (tested in similar manufacturing?)

**Excellent (85-89%):**
- Good understanding of accuracy vs. safety trade-off
- Asks about validation of vendor claims
- Shows awareness of risk implications

**Proficient (75-84%):**
- Describes situation adequately
- Asks about the decision
- Some awareness of safety concerns

**What Strong Answers Recognize:**
- 98.7% accuracy on WHICH defects? Maybe AI is better at some, worse at others
- 1.3% misses on 12,000 daily parts = 156 defective parts shipped daily
- Explainability matters for continuous improvement (if you don't know why it failed, can't fix process)
- Could use AI as first pass, humans verify AI's flagged parts
- Automotive recalls cost millions—one recall erases years of labor savings

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Questions the accuracy claims critically?
- [ ] Addresses explainability/black box concern?
- [ ] Considers hybrid human/AI approaches?
- [ ] Shows awareness of catastrophic risk implications?

║  Your mid-size law firm (45 attorneys) handles corporate     ║
║  litigation. Associates currently spend 40% of billable time ║
║  (~800 hours monthly) reviewing discovery documents. An AI   ║
║  legal tech vendor offers a system that: (1) Reviews docs    ║
║  8× faster, (2) Identifies relevant passages with 94%        ║
║  accuracy, (3) Costs $25K/month. You could reduce associate  ║
║  document review time by 75%, freeing them for higher-value  ║
║  work (depositions, research, client contact). However, the  ║
║  firm's managing partner worries: "If we train associates on ║

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**What Makes This "Hard":**
- Multiple sophisticated concerns (training, billing ethics, malpractice risk)
- Managing partner is not wrong—concerns are legitimate
- No obvious "right answer" (real dilemma)
- Requires understanding legal industry dynamics
- Must address counterarguments proactively

**Scoring Guidance:**

**Exceptional (95-100%):**
- Acknowledges all three concerns as legitimate (not dismissing them)
- Asks how to address each concern strategically (not just defend AI)
- Shows understanding of legal industry (billing practices, associate training)
- Plans to critically evaluate AI's response and build nuanced argument
- Might ask "What am I missing by framing the problem this way?"

**Excellent (90-94%):**
- Takes concerns seriously
- Asks for help addressing each concern
- Shows legal industry awareness
- Strategic thinking present

**Proficient (80-89%):**
- Describes situation adequately
- Asks for help making the case
- Some nuance but may miss depth of concerns

**What Exceptional Answers Recognize:**

**On Training Concern:**
- Maybe associates learn BETTER skills: synthesis, strategy, judgment vs. tedium
- Document review isn't actually what makes good litigators (ask veteran attorneys)
- AI could free associates for mentorship, depositions, client work

**On Billing Ethics:**
- Clients might prefer AI if it means lower bills or faster results
- Other industries already passed this hurdle (automated accounting, design software)
- Transparency could be competitive advantage ("we use technology to serve you better")

**On Error Rate:**
- 6% error on 800 hours = how many missed documents? (Need context)
- Human error rate might be higher (fatigue, attention)
- Hybrid approach: AI first pass, human review of AI-flagged items
- Could pilot on lower-stakes cases

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Dismissing concerns as "old fashioned" or "resistant to change"
- ❌ Just arguing for efficiency without addressing legitimate risks
- ❌ No hybrid approach considered
- ❌ Doesn't ask AI to challenge their own assumptions

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Addresses ALL THREE concerns seriously?
- [ ] Shows legal industry understanding?
- [ ] Asks for strategic approach (not just rebuttals)?
- [ ] Plans critical evaluation of AI's analysis?
- [ ] Considers hybrid or pilot approaches?

╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  MINI-CASE:                                                  ║
║  St. Catherine's Hospital (420 beds) uses an AI system to    ║
║  predict patient volume and optimize nurse staffing. The     ║
║  system has reduced labor costs by $1.8M annually while      ║
║  maintaining patient outcomes. However, a nurse filed a      ║
║  complaint: The AI consistently schedules her for overnight  ║
║  shifts (11pm-7am) more frequently than colleagues with      ║
║  similar seniority. She has young children and this schedule ║
║  is unsustainable. The AI vendor says: "Our algorithm        ║
║  optimizes for patient safety, staff availability patterns,  ║
║  and efficiency. We don't consider personal circumstances—   ║
║  that would bias the system." The nurse union threatens to   ║
║  file a grievance. The HR director asks: "Is the algorithm   ║
║  discriminating against parents? Or is it just that this     ║
║  nurse has higher availability for overnight shifts and the  ║
║  system is doing exactly what we asked—optimizing staffing?" ║
║                                                              ║
║  YOUR CHALLENGE:                                             ║
║  You're the hospital COO. Write a prompt asking AI to help   ║
║  you think through this situation, including what questions  ║
║  you should ask about how the algorithm works and whether    ║
║  "optimization" and "fairness" might be in tension here.     ║
║                                                              ║
║  TIME LIMIT: 5 minutes to write + submit                     ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**What Makes This "Hard":**
- Genuinely ambiguous situation (is this discrimination or optimization?)
- Competing values (efficiency vs. employee quality of life)
- Technical question (how DOES the algorithm decide?)
- Legal implications (union grievance, potential discrimination claim)
- No clear "right answer"

**Scoring Guidance:**

**Exceptional (95-100%):**
- Recognizes this is about how algorithm defines "optimization" 
- Asks what factors the AI actually considers (availability patterns? Past shift history?)
- Questions whether "not considering personal circumstances" is actually neutral
- Shows understanding that technical optimization ≠ organizational fairness
- Plans to ask AI to challenge its own analysis

**Excellent (90-94%):**
- Takes both perspectives seriously (nurse's complaint AND vendor's logic)
- Asks diagnostic questions about algorithm
- Shows awareness this is complex
- Strategic thinking about resolution

**Proficient (80-89%):**
- Describes situation adequately
- Asks for help understanding the issue
- Some awareness of tensions

**What Exceptional Answers Recognize:**

**The Core Dilemma:**
- "Not considering personal circumstances" sounds fair but might amplify existing inequities
- If algorithm learned from past data, it might perpetuate historical patterns
- Parent caregivers (disproportionately women) might have indicated "availability" for overnight shifts out of economic necessity, now system over-schedules them

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- How does algorithm define "availability"? (Past acceptance of shifts? Stated preferences?)
- Are there patterns by demographic group? (Are other parents over-scheduled overnight?)
- What happens if we add "quality of life balance" as optimization factor?
- Is the $1.8M savings worth a union grievance and demoralized staff?

**Possible Approaches:**
- Manual review of algorithm's assignments for fairness patterns
- Add constraints (max overnight shifts per month per person)
- Hybrid: AI suggests, humans approve with fairness lens
- Survey all nurses about scheduling preferences, not just infer from availability

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Immediately taking one side (nurse is right vs. algorithm is right)
- ❌ Treating this as purely technical problem (just fix the algorithm)
- ❌ Not recognizing that "optimization" requires defining what you're optimizing FOR
- ❌ Ignoring union/legal implications

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Recognizes ambiguity (both perspectives have merit)?
- [ ] Asks diagnostic questions about how algorithm works?
- [ ] Shows understanding of optimization vs. fairness tension?
- [ ] Considers organizational and legal implications?
- [ ] Plans critical evaluation of AI's analysis?

║  proposes a system that scores applications using 47 factors ║
║  (GPA, test scores, essay quality, extracurriculars, zip     ║
║  code socioeconomic data). System would flag top 12,000      ║
║  applicants for human review, auto-reject bottom 24,000, and ║
║  humans decide on middle 12,000. Vendor claims this ensures  ║

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**What Makes This "Hard":**
- Life-changing decisions for 48,000 students
- Multiple sophisticated ethical concerns
- Technical opacity (47 factors—how weighted?)
- Vendor claims "reduces bias" but might introduce different bias
- Strong emotions (admissions decisions are deeply personal)

**Scoring Guidance:**

**Exceptional (95-100%):**
- Addresses all four provost concerns systematically
- Asks how to audit the 47 factors for hidden bias
- Questions assumption that AI is more "consistent" than humans
- Shows understanding that metrics might disadvantage students AI should help
- Asks "What am I potentially missing about this problem?"

**Excellent (90-94%):**
- Takes all concerns seriously
- Asks strategic questions about validation
- Shows awareness of bias risks
- Considers implications thoughtfully

**Proficient (80-89%):**
- Describes situation adequately
- Asks about addressing concerns
- Some awareness of complexity

**What Exceptional Answers Recognize:**

**On "47 Factors" Concern:**
- Who chose those factors? Based on what?
- Might include proxies for race/class even if not explicit
- Zip code socioeconomic data could perpetuate inequality
- "Essay quality"—judged how? By what standard?

**On Auto-Reject Concern:**
- 24,000 students never get human consideration
- What if system misses late bloomer or student with compelling story?
- Legally/ethically defensible to say "AI decided"?

**On Under-Resourced Schools:**
- Students from under-resourced schools might have lower GPA/scores due to circumstances
- Strong potential ≠ strong metrics (this is entire problem with standardized measures)
- AI trained on historical data might perpetuate historical inequities

**On "Did AI Reject Me?":**
- Transparency issue (do you disclose AI use?)
- Accountability issue (who is responsible for decision?)
- Trust issue (students might feel dehumanized)

**Possible Due Diligence:**
- Audit historical decisions vs. AI decisions by demographic group
- Test on past years' applications (would AI have rejected students who succeeded?)
- Require vendor to explain factor weighting
- Pilot with human review of ALL decisions (compare)

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Defending efficiency without addressing fairness concerns
- ❌ Assuming AI is "objective" (it's trained on biased historical data)
- ❌ Not asking what happens to false negatives (rejected students who would've thrived)
- ❌ Treating consistency as inherently good (consistently wrong is still wrong)

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Addresses all four concerns systematically?
- [ ] Questions vendor's "reduces bias" claim?
- [ ] Shows understanding of structural inequality implications?
- [ ] Asks about validation and audit process?
- [ ] Plans critical evaluation of AI's analysis?

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**Why This Debate Works:**
- Genuinely controversial (no obvious right answer)
- Relevant to students' work lives
- Both sides have strong arguments
- Involves competing values (productivity vs. trust)

**FOR Arguments (Expect to Hear):**
- Employers pay for productivity, have right to measure it
- Notification means no deception (employees know)
- Helps identify where training or support is needed
- Some roles require monitoring (financial services, healthcare)
- Prevents time theft or misuse of company resources

**AGAINST Arguments (Expect to Hear):**
- Surveillance destroys trust and morale
- Monitoring stress reduces actual productivity
- Privacy concerns even at work
- Keystrokes ≠ thinking/creativity
- Creates adversarial relationship

**Strong Counterarguments Teams Should Address:**

*If FOR:*
- Must acknowledge surveillance harms morale/trust
- Must explain when monitoring is vs. isn't appropriate
- Should address "notification doesn't equal consent" (power imbalance)

*If AGAINST:*
- Must acknowledge employers have legitimate interest in productivity
- Must explain alternatives to monitoring
- Should address remote work accountability concerns

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**Why This Debate Works:**
- Current real-world debate (many industries grappling with this)
- Both sides have legitimate concerns
- Involves trust, transparency, practical enforcement

**FOR Arguments (Expect to Hear):**
- Consumers have right to know what they're reading/viewing
- Builds trust through transparency
- Helps people understand what AI can/can't do
- Similar to nutritional labels or "paid advertising" disclosures
- Protects against misinformation

**AGAINST Arguments (Expect to Hear):**
- Where do you draw the line? (Grammarly? Spellcheck? AI editing?)
- Creates stigma that AI-assisted work is inferior
- Unenforceable (especially for content from other countries)
- Humans edit AI content anyway—is it "AI-generated" or "human-created"?
- Adds regulatory burden for unclear benefit

**Strong Counterarguments:**

*If FOR:*
- Must address "where's the line?" problem
- Must explain enforcement mechanism
- Should acknowledge AI is a tool (like calculator)

*If AGAINST:*
- Must acknowledge transparency concerns
- Must propose alternative accountability mechanism
- Should address misinformation/deep fakes

**Scoring:** Same structure as S3-D1

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**Why This Debate Works:**
- Directly addresses automation anxiety
- Involves economic and moral questions
- Both sides have compelling arguments
- Relevant to students' career concerns

**FOR Arguments (Expect to Hear):**
- Companies profit from automation, should share responsibility
- Workers didn't choose to have jobs automated away
- Retraining creates more productive workforce (benefits everyone)
- Society benefits if displaced workers can transition
- "Moral responsibility" for disrupting people's livelihoods

**AGAINST Arguments (Expect to Hear):**
- Shouldn't penalize innovation and efficiency
- Government should handle retraining (that's what taxes are for)
- Unfair to companies who adopt AI vs. those who don't
- How do you measure which jobs AI "eliminated"?
- Creates perverse incentive to not automate (bad for competitiveness)

**Strong Counterarguments:**

*If FOR:*
- Must address "penalizing innovation" concern
- Must explain how to measure "jobs eliminated by AI"
- Should propose practical implementation mechanism

*If AGAINST:*
- Must acknowledge worker displacement is real
- Must propose alternative support mechanism
- Should address moral responsibility question

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**Why This Debate Works:**
- High stakes (medical decisions = life/death)
- Pits data/accuracy against human judgment/context
- Genuinely hard question with no clear answer
- Forces thinking about AI authority vs. AI assistance

**FOR Arguments (Expect to Hear):**
- If AI is more accurate, patients deserve that information
- Doctors make mistakes—AI could catch them
- Patient autonomy (they choose, not AI or doctor forcing)
- Already happens with other medical tools (lab tests can contradict doctor)
- Lives could be saved

**AGAINST Arguments (Expect to Hear):**
- AI doesn't understand full patient context
- Accuracy on average ≠ accuracy for specific patient
- Undermines doctor-patient relationship/trust
- Liability nightmare (who's responsible if AI is wrong?)
- "Overrule" implies AI has authority it shouldn't have

**Strong Counterarguments:**

*If FOR:*
- Must address trust/relationship concerns
- Must explain liability framework
- Should acknowledge AI doesn't have full patient context

*If AGAINST:*
- Must address "what if AI is right and saves lives?"
- Must propose how to use AI diagnostics appropriately
- Should explain why doctor's judgment trumps higher accuracy

**Scoring:** Same structure as S3-D1

║  MINI-CASE:                                                  ║
║  Your popular restaurant (150 seats) is fully booked most    ║
║  weekends but 40% empty on weekdays. An AI system offers     ║
║  dynamic pricing: Higher prices during peak demand (Friday-  ║
║  Sunday dinner), lower prices during slow periods. Projected ║
║  revenue increase: 22%. Cost: $250/month. Example: Steak     ║
║  currently $32 would range from $25 (Tuesday lunch) to $38   ║
║  (Saturday 7pm). Your chef says: "This is smart business."   ║
║  Your general manager says: "Customers will feel like we're  ║
║  price-gouging, especially our regulars who always come      ║
║  Saturdays." This could be industry-changing or PR disaster. ║
║                                                              ║
║  YOUR CHALLENGE:                                             ║
║  Write a prompt asking AI to help you think through this     ║
║  decision, particularly how customers might react and        ║
║  whether there are ways to implement dynamic pricing without ║
║  alienating your core customers.                             ║

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**Medium complexity:** Revenue vs. customer relationship trade-off, fairness perception, framing/transparency

**Strong answers:** Consider transparency (post prices clearly vs. surprise), loyalty programs (regular customers exempt?), test with small price ranges first, learn from airline/Uber experiences

║  Your city police department is considering a predictive     ║
║  policing AI system that analyzes crime data to identify     ║
║  "hot spots" where patrols should focus. Vendor claims 28%   ║
║  reduction in property crimes in similar cities. However,    ║
║  civil rights groups warn: "This system will over-police     ║
║  minority neighborhoods because it's trained on historical   ║
║  data reflecting biased policing patterns. More police in an ║
║  area leads to more arrests, which the AI interprets as more ║
║  crime, creating a feedback loop." Police chief responds:    ║
║  "We're using data, not bias. This is more objective than    ║
║  human intuition." But an internal analysis shows the AI     ║
║  recommends 3× more patrol hours in predominantly Black      ║
║  neighborhoods despite similar crime rates across the city.  ║
║  You're on the city council and must vote on $450K contract. ║

║  YOUR CHALLENGE:                                             ║
║  Write a prompt asking AI to help you understand this        ║
║  situation deeply: How could historical bias create feedback ║
║  loops? What would you need to know to evaluate whether this ║
║  system is actually "objective"? What alternatives exist?    ║
║                                                              ║

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**Hard complexity:** High stakes (civil rights), technical feedback loop concept, both sides have valid points, no easy answer

**Exceptional answers:** Understand that "trained on historical data" IS the problem, ask what "similar crime rates" means (reported vs. actual), question whether "objective" means "fair," consider alternatives to predictive policing

║  underwriting system that analyzes genetic markers (from     ║
║  consumer DNA testing services like 23andMe) along with      ║
║  traditional factors. The AI can predict life expectancy and ║
║  disease risk with unprecedented accuracy. This means: (1)   ║
║  You could offer lower premiums to genetically low-risk      ║
║  people, (2) You'd charge higher premiums or deny coverage   ║
║  to genetically high-risk people. Your actuaries say this is ║
║  "fair" because pricing should reflect risk. But bioethicists║
║  warn: "People don't choose their genetics—charging based on ║
║  genetic risk is discrimination against inherited traits.    ║
║  Insurance is supposed to pool risk across populations, not  ║
║  exclude people who need it most." Current law is ambiguous. ║
║  If you don't use genetic data and competitors do, you'll    ║
║  only get high-risk customers (adverse selection). If you do ║

║  220 human moderators reviewing reported content for policy  ║
║  violations (hate speech, harassment, misinformation,        ║
║  violence). Moderators are burnt out—they review 400 reports ║
║  daily and suffer vicarious trauma from disturbing content.  ║
║  An AI system could handle 85% of clear-cut cases            ║
║  automatically, letting humans focus on nuanced decisions.   ║
║  Cost: $2.8M annually (vs. $12M for current team). But: (1) ║
║  AI makes mistakes—might remove legitimate speech or miss    ║
║  subtle violations, (2) Users complain current appeal process║
║  is already frustrating—AI would make 100× more decisions to ║
║  appeal, (3) Cultural context matters—AI trained on English  ║
║  content struggles with non-English slang, (4) Free speech   ║
║  advocates say automated censorship is dangerous, (5) Your   ║
║  moderators' union opposes job elimination even though work  ║

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**Hard complexity:** Multiple concerns (accuracy, appeals, cultural context, labor, free speech), tension between moderator wellbeing and job security, scale challenges

**Exceptional answers:** Recognize this isn't binary (hybrid models possible), ask about error rates (false positives vs. false negatives), question whether "85% of clear-cut cases" means it's actually 85% of VOLUME, consider moderator input in system design

║  Your pharmaceutical company is recruiting for a cancer drug ║
║  clinical trial (need 2,000 participants, 30% enrollment).   ║
║  Traditional recruitment is slow and expensive. An AI system ║
║  can analyze electronic health records of millions of        ║
║  patients to identify ideal candidates and predict which     ║
║  ones are most likely to complete the 24-month trial (better ║
║  data quality). The AI prioritizes: patients near research   ║
║  sites, stable housing/employment, history of medication     ║
║  compliance. However, this systematically excludes: low-     ║
║  income patients (unstable housing), rural patients (far from║
║  sites), patients with past financial struggles (couldn't    ║
║  afford medications, thus "non-compliant"). Your chief       ║
║  medical officer says: "We need reliable data to prove drug  ║
║  efficacy—we can't afford dropouts." Your ethics board says: ║
║  "This creates a system where new treatments are only tested ║

║  appearances. Vendor claims it's more accurate than judges   ║
║  at predicting who will appear for trial. Projected outcome: ║
║  Fewer people jailed pre-trial (saves $8M annually), more    ║
║  consistent decisions across judges. But investigative       ║
║  reporters found: (1) System recommends cash bail 2.4× more  ║
║  often for Black defendants than white defendants with       ║
║  identical risk scores, (2) "Employment status" and "zip     ║
║  code" are proxies for race/class, (3) People with public   ║

║  attorneys. Public defender's office threatens lawsuit. DA   ║
║  says: "This is better than judges' gut feelings which are   ║

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**Hard complexity:** Criminal justice context (high stakes), "better than biased humans" is low bar, proxies for protected classes, no obvious solution

**Exceptional answers:** Understand that employment/zip code ARE the bias even if not explicitly race, ask whether "accurate prediction" is the right goal (vs. equal treatment), recognize both judge bias and algorithmic bias are problems

║  work. Early results: (1) International students whose       ║
║  English is their second language get flagged 3× more often  ║
║  (their formal writing patterns resemble AI), (2) Students   ║
║  who used AI for editing/grammar-checking (allowed per       ║
║  policy) sometimes get flagged, (3) Students legitimately    ║
║  accused feel humiliated by interrogation process, (4) Some  ║
║  students who DID use AI inappropriately aren't caught       ║
║  (false negatives). Faculty are divided: Some say "we need   ║
║  this to preserve academic integrity," others say "we're     ║
║  creating a surveillance culture and discriminating against  ║
║  ESL students." The student newspaper wrote an editorial:    ║

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**Hard complexity:** ESL discrimination issue is serious, 89% accuracy means 11% false positives, interrogation process creates harm even when cleared, questions purpose of assessment itself

**Exceptional answers:** Ask whether AI detection is addressing symptoms vs. root problem (why do students cheat?), recognize ESL discrimination is unacceptable regardless of good intentions, consider redesigning assessments to be AI-resistant rather than AI-detecting

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**FOR:** Exploits vulnerability (e.g., sad? show comfort food ads), consent isn't meaningful when people don't understand implications, erosion of emotional privacy, manipulative

**AGAINST:** Already happening with traditional marketing psychology, customers benefit from relevant offers, if they consent it's legitimate, banning stifles innovation, hard to enforce

**AGAINST:** Revealing algorithm allows gaming the system, destroys competitive advantage, most users don't care about technical details, would make apps less effective

**INSTRUCTOR NOTES:**

**FOR:** Frees teachers for actual teaching (not grading), provides faster feedback, might be MORE consistent than humans, human review option protects students

**AGAINST:** Misses nuance and growth, reduces writing to checklist, students will game the AI, devalues teacher expertise, "request human review" puts burden on students
