## DETAILED INSTRUCTOR NOTES BY CARD

### Card S3-01: Coffee Shop Inventory (Easy - 100 points)

**What Makes This "Easy":**
- Single straightforward business problem (inventory waste)
- Clear context provided (3 locations, Excel data, no tech background)
- Obvious what's being asked (understand possibilities + first steps)

**Scoring Using Prompt Quality Rubric:**

**Exceptional (90-100 pts):**
- Provides Maria's context (small business, no tech staff, intimidated)
- Asks for explanation of options (not just recommendation)
- Frames as "help me understand" not "tell me what to do"
- Sets up follow-up: "After you explain options, I'll want to know..."

**Proficient (70-89 pts):**
- Mentions key context (Excel data, no technical experience)
- Asks for something useful (understanding options or first steps)
- Shows awareness this is about helping Maria think

**Developing (50-69 pts):**
- Generic question ("How can AI help with inventory?")
- Minimal context provided
- Asks AI to make the decision

**Common Mistakes to Watch:**
- ❌ "What should Maria do?" (delegates decision)
- ❌ No mention of her constraints (no tech staff, intimidated)
- ❌ Asks for complex technical solution (doesn't match her capabilities)
- ❌ No follow-up questions planned

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Context about Maria's situation?
- [ ] Asks to understand options (not just get answer)?
- [ ] Appropriate for her capabilities?
- [ ] Sets up follow-up or critical evaluation?

**Sample Strong Prompt:**
"I'm helping a coffee shop owner who has 18 months of daily sales data in Excel but no technical background. She's interested in using AI to reduce inventory waste but is intimidated by technology. Can you explain what's realistically possible with her data, what tools exist that don't require programming skills, and what her first 2-3 steps should be to explore this? I want to help her make an informed decision, not just tell her what to do."

- ❌ Treats AI as copywriter rather than thinking partner

**Quick Scoring Checklist:**
