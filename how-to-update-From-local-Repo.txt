✦ Here are the steps to add new files to your local repository and then sync them with GitHub:

   1. Place the new files into your project folder: C:\Users\mikeb\my Google Drive\AI game files.

   2. Stage the files: Open your terminal, navigate to the project folder, and use the git add command. You have two
      common options:
       * To add all new and modified files: git add .
       * To add a specific file: git add <filename>

   3. Commit the files: This saves the changes to your local repository. Use a descriptive message that explains what
      you've added.
       * git commit -m "Add new feature files"

   4. Push the commit to GitHub: This will upload your new files to the remote repository.
       * git push

  In summary, the workflow is: add -> commit -> push.

> if I just add the files can you then do the commit then push

✦ Yes, I can certainly do that.

  Please go ahead and place the additional files into your local repository directory: C:\Users\mikeb\my Google Drive\AI
  game files.

  Once you've done that, let me know, and I will then stage all the new files, commit them with a message you provide,
  and push them to your GitHub repository.
